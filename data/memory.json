    "solution": "### Step-by-Step Explanation\nTo solve the given expression $9 - 3 + (1/3) + 1$, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses: $(1/3)$ is already simplified.\n2. Next, we perform any exponents (none in this case).\n3. Then, we perform any multiplication or division operations from left to right (none in this case).\n4. Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction operations from left to right.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$9 - 3 + (1/3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1/3 + 1$\n\nLet's simplify step by step:\n- Subtract 3 from 9: $9 - 3 = 6$\n- Add 1 to that result: $6 + 1 = 7$\n- Add $1/3$ to that result: $7 + 1/3$\n\nTo add $7 + 1/3$, we can convert the whole number into a fraction with the same denominator to make the addition easier:\n$7 = 21/3$\n\nSo, $7 + 1/3 = 21/3 + 1/3 = 22/3$\n\n### Final Answer\n",

In this case, we have 20 units and we add 40 more units, so we count a total of 60 units.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of 20 and 40 is a basic arithmetic operation that involves combining two quantities to get a total.\n\n### Final Answer\n**60**",
